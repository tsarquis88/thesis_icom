\chapter*{Abstract}

This paper presents the design of an IF (\emph{Intermediate Frequency}) signal receptor in order to modernize the one included on the Vitro RIR-778C tracking radar. 

The radar's technique for doing the object tracking is the one called \emph{monopulse}, therefore this new system has to process the signals according to this method.

For a proper signal processing, the IF analog signals are converted to a digital form by undersampling them.

The physical device chosen for accomplish this is an FPGA programmed by a hardware description language.

Despite the fact that it wasn't possible to perform real tests in the radar's environment, final results are promising, being very similar to those who'd been simulated.
